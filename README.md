webcompat-metrics is a JavaScript application using [Next.js] and [React] to power metrics for [webcompat.com]

### Quick Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat-metrics-client.git

cd webcompat-metrics-client

npm install
npm run dev
# Go to http://localhost:3001
```

### Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
# Go to http://localhost:3001
```

### Configuration
#### Environment variables

You can create a `.env` file (or copy `.env.example`) and modify variables, make sure variables are all set.

By default `.env.local` is loaded and injected through the [Next.js] configuration.

### Testing

For testing DOM, React components, and other JavaScript, we use [Jest], [Enzyme] and [Sinon.JS].

For the linting JavaScript process, we use [Prettier] and [Eslint].

For the linting CSS process, we use [stylelint].

You can test the full application locally with:

```bash
# for all tests
npm run test
# only do linting:
npm run lint
# only run DOM/React tests:
npm run test:jest
```

If your changes will alter the appearance of any views, be sure to update the [Jest] snapshots before running tests:

```bash
npm run test:jest -- -u
```

### How to Add a New Dashboard

1. Add an endpoint for the new dashboard in [`src/routes/index.js`](https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat-metrics-client/blob/8ab26fa6475ea376d0ea4dafdd520f6a73faec11/src/routes/index.js#L14).
   
2. Add a new container directory for your dashboard in the `src/containers/` directory, and build a container for it using the[`MetricsTemplate` model](https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat-metrics-client/blob/a65bcd87702425fba9f39fa6d026c1bcb2e488c0/src/containers/MetricsTemplate/index.js#L24).
   
3. Add at least one test for your new dashboard container in a `__tests__` directory inside your container directory.

4. Add a new page in [`src/pages`](https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat-metrics-client/tree/8ab26fa6475ea376d0ea4dafdd520f6a73faec11/src/pages).

5. Import your new dashboard component to your new page in [`src/pages`](https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat-metrics-client/blob/8ab26fa6475ea376d0ea4dafdd520f6a73faec11/src/pages/needstriage.js#L5-L19).
   
6. Update the [Jest] snapshots so that they will include your new dashboard views -- as shown in the [testing](#testing) section.
